# Welcome to my blog

It's fun having you here, this is my first post. I've pretty much used the most maintainable method to create this blog.

So I used a github repository to hold all my .MD articles and just fetched them from the site ;)

It's obviously not as efficient as using the dev.to api but the stuff I post there sometimes is off-topic and not stuff you'd put on a professional blog lol

```javascript
console.log("New Blog :D");
```

```rust
fn main(){
  println!("Hello World!");
}
```
